Just like with Tic-Tac-Toe, this was initially a really simple project to recreate Brick Breaker,
but I did extra and polished the project with my own art and effects to make it satisfying to play!

Polishing:
  - Created a shader to apply "flashing" effects to a brick when it is hit
  - Created a "ring shockwave" shader that I used for a variety of effects, notably the big explosion from the bomb brick
  - Screen shake!

Additionally, I designed a ton of extra mechanics:
  - Bricks with multiple "layers" (like Bloons Tower Defense)
  - Metal bricks that can not be broken by the ball
  - Bomb bricks that explode nearby bricks and destroy metal bricks
  - An exprimental "combo meter" that builds up for continually destroying bricks and grants point multipliers, BUT makes the ball go faster
